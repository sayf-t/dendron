## Intro
Ethernaut is a ...

## What & Why
While it is easy to just to code an execute everything easily through your dev console / remix, it is worth trying out setting up the local network blockchain because...

> Even though Ethernaut is a browser game, you’ll want to reproduce levels on your computer to better understand them, test ideas, and quickly iterate with solutions. That’s why you’ll need a tool to make smart contracts development as easy and comfortable as possible.

>[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is the best Solidity development tool at the moment. It comes with a template to set up a Solidity project and frees you from the need to run and manage a local Ethereum network. It just works! Also, Hardhat has a configured and transparent testing environment, which allows you to iterate super fast compared to other development environments.

>One extremely useful feature of Hardhat is `hardhat/console.sol` contract that allows you print to the console from smart contracts! It provides `console.log()` function in your Solditiy code, as well as other functions to print different data types (e.g. `console.logBytes32()`). With this function, it’ll be much easier for you to understand what happens in a contract and find out if something goes wrong.

>[Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is a browser IDE for writing and deploying smart contracts. The fact that it runs in browser and that it’s connected to MetaMask allows you to deploy contracts in a couple of clicks. Everyone uses Remix. Spend some time to get comfortable with it, this will pay back.
